Welcome to my website! Starting in September, I will be a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics in the [Mathematics and Statistics Department](https://www.carleton.edu/math/) at Carleton College. I earned my [PhD in Political Science](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/kurtz217) from the University of Minnesota. I am also an alumna of the [Population Studies training program](https://pop.umn.edu/people/emily-kurtz) with UMN's Minnesota Population Center.

My research interests are in American political economy, political geography, and political methodology. I am broadly interested in how industry death over generations influences political behavior even today. My dissertation focused on the question of why folks living in some parts of the country resist retraining in new types of jobs, such as those in green energy, even though they have the training and credentials to perform those types of jobs and their local economy could use such an economic boost. This was a big story in the 2016 presidential election in particular, with Hillary Clinton focusing on a strategy of embracing advanced manufacturing and Donald Trump promising to bring back old, off-shored manufacturing jobs. Of course, Joe Biden had thoughts on the retraining issues as well, saying, "Anybody who can go down 3,000 feet in a mine can sure as hell learn to program as well."

While geographic trends in national politics may imply that Trump's reshoring message resonates more with those living in battleground states like Michigan or Pennsylvania, my dissertation does not necessarily support that conclusion. Indeed, those living in and around famous post-industrial cities like Detroit or Cleveland are more, not less, likely to embrace job retraining. This raises some questions: is the old story of ex-manufacturing workers overlooking new manufacturing jobs in favor of a longshot return of their former jobs just that, old? Were the measurement decisions I made in analyzing my data and writing my dissertation inaccurate (Answer: probably at least somewhat)? Or have we long overestimated these people's resistance to job retraining? Might they be more interested in they can come to trust that job retraining can be done in the right way? I look forward to building off of my dissertation and exploring this more policy-oriented angle to the broad research question.

Of course, I am not just a researcher. During my time at UMN, I was heavily involved in student leadership and service. I was a member of the Council of Graduate Students for four years and the University Senate for two years. I organized my department's American Politics Colloquium for three years and co-organized the [Political Methodology Colloquium](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/mpmc/home?authuser=0) for a year.

Before joining my current department, I was a graduate student in the School of Statistics (2017-2020), a Technical Services Analyst at Epic Systems (2015-2017), and an undergrad in Math and Environmental Studies at Wellesley College (2011-2015). I grew up in Northeast Ohio. In my spare time, I like to travel. I've been to 49 states and - I think - 18 countries, but honestly often most enjoy visiting the city and state parks around my home. I also like to play strategy games, watch Cleveland sports (Minnesota sports are also acceptable), go on walks around my local lake, and eat good food. Occasionally, I become interested in a topic and must learn everything about it (I now know too much about electric vehicles). I am a fan of fall, gardening, and biking.
