Welcome to my website! I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics in the [Mathematics and Statistics Department](https://www.carleton.edu/math/) at Carleton College. I earned my [PhD in Political Science](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/kurtz217) from the University of Minnesota. I am also an alumna of the [Population Studies training program](https://pop.umn.edu/people/emily-kurtz) with UMN's Minnesota Population Center, and I hold a Master's in Statistics from UMN's School of Statistics. 

I am excited to be at Carleton for the next two years teaching students across many majors how to use data and do statistics. That is, frankly, what got me interested in pursuing a career in higher education in the first place: I want to teach everyone, not just those people who think they are "math people," how useful math and statistics can be in helping us make sense of the world.

In addition to teaching, I spend a lot of time thinking about research. My research interests are in American political economy, political geography, and political methodology. I am broadly interested in how industry death over generations influences political behavior even today. My dissertation focused on the question of why folks living in some parts of the country resist retraining in new types of jobs, such as those in green energy, even though they have the training and credentials to perform those types of jobs and their local economy could use such an economic boost. This issue has been a major focus both in electoral politics, with Democratic candidates tending to push for investments in advanced manufacturing and Republican candidates focusing on bringing back old jobs, and in the policy space, with Biden's Inflation Reduction Act investing in green energy job training in the American Heartland and Trump's tariffs motivated by the desire to have more goods built in America.

During my time at UMN, I was heavily involved in student leadership and service. I was a member of the Council of Graduate Students for four years and the University Senate for two years. I organized my department's American Politics Colloquium for three years and co-organized the [Political Methodology Colloquium](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/mpmc/home?authuser=0) for a year.

Before going to graduate school and joining my current department at Carleton, I was a Technical Services Analyst at Epic Systems (2015-2017). I earned my B.A. in Math and Environmental Studies at Wellesley College (2011-2015). I grew up in Northeast Ohio. In my spare time, I like to travel. I've been to 49 states and - I think - 18 countries, but honestly often most enjoy visiting the city and state parks around my home in St. Paul, Minnesota. I also like to play strategy games, watch Cleveland sports (Minnesota sports are also acceptable), go on walks around my local lake, and eat good food. I am a fan of fall, gardening, and biking.
